* Comes with an own beautiful color theme, which not only includes all the [recommended groups](http://manual.macromates.com/en/language_grammars), but also some special rules for grammar elements that you won't find in other themes (e.g. alt labels and options). They are, immodestly, named `Complete Dark` and `Complete Light`.

### Code Completion + Symbol Information

* Code suggestions for all rule + optioins ,  etc. (including built-in ones).
* Symbol type + location are shown on mouse hover. Navigate to any symbol with Ctrl/Cmd + Click. This works even for nested grammars.
